# What we did :
We finished all the tasks, making sure our project meets all requirements and efficiently manages many images. 
We created a command-line interface (CLI) and a web server to manage images. 
The CLI and server can list, read, insert, and delete images in ImgFS. 
We used the VIPS library for image resizing and the libjson-c library for handling JSON data.
Our web server supports multiple clients at the same time with multithreading. 
We thoroughly tested our system with unit and end-to-end tests and added detailed error checks in week 12 & 13.

# Remarks about our project :
We kept some perrors used for debugging.

Thanks for the project and your efforts answering us in Ed ;)
